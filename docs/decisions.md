# Design Decisions

Decisions are logged here before implementation. Each entry states what was decided, why, what was ruled out, and what it constrains going forward.

```
### [D-NNN] Title
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**What**: What was decided.
**Why**: The reason — constraint, evidence, or trade-off that drove the choice.
**Ruled out**: Alternatives considered and why they were rejected.
**Constrains**: What future decisions or implementations this locks in.

## Decisions

### [D-001] Target system is the ASMPT dual-gantry (García-Herreros et al.)
**Date**: 2026-03-16
**What**: The sole target system for this project is the ASMPT dual-gantry stage modeled by García-Herreros et al.
**Why**: This is the industrial use case for the graduation project. All other benchmarks (MSD, Bouc-Wen, Cascaded Tanks) are reference implementations of the augmentation framework only.
**Ruled out**: Using MSD or other benchmarks as the target system.
**Constrains**: All new code, data pipelines, and model structures must be built around the gantry system.

### [D-002] MATLAB files in `kamtin-fp-model/` are immutable
**Date**: 2026-03-16
**What**: The MATLAB model files defining the FP model structure are the ground truth and must never be modified.
**Why**: They represent the validated physical model from García-Herreros et al. and are the hard constraint that the Python implementation must conform to.
**Ruled out**: Adapting the MATLAB model to fit the Python code. The direction of adaptation is always MATLAB → Python, never the reverse.
**Constrains**: Any Python state-space implementation must reproduce the structure defined in the MATLAB files exactly.

### [D-003] Augmentation structure is parallel dynamic LFR
**Date**: 2026-03-16
**What**: The augmentation architecture is a parallel dynamic structure within the LFR framework.
**Why**: Parallel structure is required for orthogonal projection-based regularization (Gyorok et al.), which prevents the learned component from capturing dynamics already described by the baseline. Dynamic (not static) augmentation is needed because cross-coupling and position-dependent flexible dynamics require additional learned states beyond the baseline.
**Ruled out**: Series interconnection (incompatible with orthogonal projection regularization); static augmentation (cannot capture dynamics requiring additional states).
**Constrains**: The LFR interconnection must be realized as a parallel structure. Regularization implementation follows Gyorok et al.

### [D-004] Scheduling variable is payload position Y
**Date**: 2026-03-16
**What**: The LPV scheduling variable is the payload position Y.
**Why**: Y enters the inertia matrix algebraically in the García-Herreros model, making it the natural scheduling variable. Since Y is a system state (not an exogenous signal), the formulation is quasi-LPV. Y is directly available from the physical model and does not need to be identified from data.
**Ruled out**: Data-driven scheduling variable identification (not needed here since Y follows from the physics).
**Constrains**: The LPV discretization must handle Y as a state-dependent scheduling variable. Invertibility of the position-dependent inertia matrix must be verified across the full operational range.

### [D-006] Python implementation uses stage coordinates
**Date**: 2026-03-16
**What**: The Python discrete-time state-space model is implemented in stage coordinates: states q = [X1, X2, Y, dX1, dX2, dY], inputs u = [F_X1, F_X2, F_Y], outputs y = [X1, X2, Y].
**Why**: Real experimental gantry data is measured in stage coordinates (X1, X2, Y from encoders; F_X1, F_X2, F_Y from amplifiers). The model must match the data — the model is coordinate-independent, so the data determines the choice. The MATLAB model also discretizes in stage coordinates (`c2d(StageCoordinatesSystem, ts, 'zoh')`), providing a direct reference.
**Ruled out**: Logical coordinates [X, Θ, Y] — the augmentation framework trains on measured data, which is in stage coordinates. Working in logical coordinates would require transforming every data sample and adds no benefit.
**Constrains**: The A, B, C, D matrices passed to the augmentation blocks must be in stage coordinates. Normalization statistics (T_x, T_u, T_y) must also be computed from stage-coordinate data.

### [D-007] Implement fixed baseline first, add trainability in a second step
**Date**: 2026-03-16
**What**: The Python FP model is first implemented as a fixed (non-trainable) baseline using `Linear_State_Block` and `Linear_Output_Block`. Trainability (`Parameterized_Linear_State_Block` / `Parameterized_Linear_Output_Block`) is added only after the fixed baseline is validated end-to-end in the augmentation interconnect.
**Why**: Stepwise approach reduces the number of failure modes at each stage. A fixed baseline is easier to verify (output is deterministic and can be compared directly against the MATLAB `G` matrices). Trainability introduces regularization and gradient flow, which should only be debugged once the structural wiring is confirmed correct.
**Ruled out**: Going straight to parameterized blocks — adds trainable parameters and param_loss complexity before the block shapes, wiring, and normalization are validated.
**Constrains**: Validation milestone required before promoting to parameterized blocks: simulated output from the Python baseline must match the MATLAB `c2d` matrices to numerical tolerance.

### [D-005] LFR-LPV augmentation adaptation is deferred
**Date**: 2026-03-16
**What**: Extending the augmentation framework to the full LPV-LFR setting is deferred to a later phase.
**Why**: The immediate priority is getting the FP model into the correct discrete-time state-space form compatible with the existing augmentation code. LPV-LFR augmentation adds complexity that should not be introduced before the baseline integration is validated.
**Ruled out**: Attempting LPV-LFR augmentation before the FP model baseline is working.
**Constrains**: Current work focuses on FP model conversion and compatibility with the existing LFR interconnect. LPV scheduling in the augmentation layer comes after.
